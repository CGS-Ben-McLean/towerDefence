My Tower Defence game (javascript)

Hey guys.

Through this you can see all the changes I made in the code. I will be adding comments soon, to make it easier to read.

I hope you enjoy this.

ALSO: If you want me to explain a bit of code from the repo, or are curious as to what it does, just select the code, copy it, paste it on to my Tower Defence forum page, and I will explain it, and how it affects other pieces of code.


Thanks to Alex Malone for coming up with the idea.
